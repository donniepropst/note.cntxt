# What is note.cntxt?
note.cntxt is the solution to after-hour communication in the workplace.
Leave reminders called notes for yourself or your co-workers at any time, and only receive them when you are at work!

Using Estimote beacons at the workplace to receive contextual location-based notes, we can increase productivity in the
workplace by maintaining employee health and keeping a healthy work-life balance. Learn more [here](http://www.ibtimes.com/after-hours-use-work-email-may-finally-see-some-labor-regulations-1940882).
